# Bilrubin_prediction_analysis
prediction of bilirubin levels in Jaundice patients.


the data in csv file is not good . The better the data the good the results.

But still the program tells us about the max bilrubin levels that should not be exceeded by the person (or) patient. If the results are more than the given data, then he should be taken intl immediate medical attention

I used LSTM MODEL for learning of the data (cuz the data is seqential)
added the graphs for some good UI...
